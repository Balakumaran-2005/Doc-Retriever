Hybrid PDF & Web Knowledge Extraction System
ðŸ“Œ Overview
This project is an AI-powered multi-source question answering engine designed to extract and retrieve information from PDF documents and linked web pages.
It enhances traditional PDF-based QA by detecting embedded URLs inside documents, fetching their web content, and combining both sources for more complete, accurate answers.

ðŸš€ Features
PDF Document Parsing â€“ Extracts text from PDF files using PyPDFLoader.
Embedded URL Detection â€“ Scans document content for hyperlinks.
Linked Web Content Retrieval â€“ Downloads and processes webpages referenced in the PDF.
Semantic Search â€“ Uses FAISS vector store with HuggingFaceEmbeddings for efficient retrieval.
Context-Aware Answers â€“ Combines PDF and web context to generate precise responses using LangChain.
FastAPI REST API â€“ Exposes an endpoint for automated question answering.
Asynchronous Processing â€“ Fetches and processes multiple sources in parallel for speed.
In-Memory Caching â€“ Avoids reprocessing the same document URLs.
